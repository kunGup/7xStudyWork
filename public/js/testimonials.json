        "testimonial":"I acheived a BITSAT score of 281. My application number is 20071062. I completed my schooling from Gyan Bharti, Saket, Delhi. I also got really great marks in PCM (Maths 95, Chemistry 93, Physics 93). I enrolled in 7xstudy and they really helped me strengthen my concepts. The best thing that I explored here was that teachers focus more on pointing out the weakness of the student and they work rigorously in converting the weak points into the strong ones. I am really grateful to Agarwal sir who always directed me like a guardian and made Chemistry my strongest subject which was the weakest before joining 7xstudy. I am also thankful to Navjot sir for Maths, Pawan sir for Physics who helped me boost my performance. Teachers from 7xstudy really helped me to emerge out as a better human being.",
